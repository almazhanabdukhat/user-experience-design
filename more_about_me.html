          I have recently completed an internship at a consulting firm in NY
          where I've built an app that calculates Daily Light Integral, a value
          that indicates how much light a plant receives at a particular date
          and location. Calculating DLI can help to select when and which crops
          to grow at the chosen location based on how much light a plant
          receives and what cover type for buildings is used.

          In January, I was a fellow at a TavTech technology fellowship in
          Tel-Aviv (sponsored by NYU), where I learnt about cybersecurity,
          Israeli start-up scene and ate lots of falafels. We also had visits to
          local tech start-ups and big corporate offices (i.e. Google).
          <br />

          I have recently visited Louvre Abu Dhabi in the UAE as I studied away
          at NYU's Abu Dhabi campus - I really enjoyed the experience and learnt
          quite a bit about local modern art. Louvre Abu Dhabi had exhibits from
          the original Louvre and museums all around the world.
