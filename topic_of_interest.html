        <h1>Most common K-drama tropes</h1>
        <p>
          Hello! I am a big fan of k-dramas (doramas) and on this page I will be
          discussing the most common tropes that you might encounter in k-dramas
          :) Every good dorama has a few tropes here and there - sometimes we
          love them, sometimes we love to <em>hate</em> them and they are always
          fun and even somewhat comforting to watch...so, let's dive in!
        </p>

        <h2>Destined love.</h2>
        <p>
          Characters meet and fall in love per usual, but then, turns out, they
          already had a <em>very</em> significant connection in the past and
          forgot about it (i.e. they were raised in the same orphanage or their
          family members were/are enemies or even worse - dated). Usually, small
          hints are given throughout the series and the big revelation happens
          to the end of the series. Commonly this trope is employed when there
          is a need to spice things up.

        <h2>Amnesia</h2>
        <p>
          Main characters are living happily and then, due to some unfortunate
          events, one character experiences memory loss (either due to accident
          or medical trauma). Of course, amnesia is a serious illness and is not
          a topic for jokes. However, in k-dramas amnesia occurs too more often
          and works as a very effective plot to create suspense. Commonly, in
          spite of the memory loss, main characters still fall in love once
          again or their memory suddenly recovers due to a very fortunate
          sequence of events. Amnesia trope is a powerful way to emphasize that
          some couples will be together no matter what.

          For the trope #3, I combined two tropes that quite frequently appear
          together. You can press a button to see the trope that interests you

        <h2>Stalking second lead.</h2>
        <p>
          In k-dramas, stalking is quite common for both genders - it can be
          both cute and a bit disturbing if start analyzing all the
          psychological implications. In k-dramas, stalking is used to add some
          fun and cuteness to the drama and show how attractive the object of
          the pursuit is. Try clicking on images to simulate stalking for a bit.
